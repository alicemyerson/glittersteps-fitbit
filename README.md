GlitterSteps - a glittery fitbit clock face for Versa 2.

The watchface becomes more glittery as you step towards your goal (insert something awful here about both looking and feeling fantastic).
It's my first attempt, done in a few hours while suffering from coronavirus.  Typographic inspiration from darkface by rootasjey.
